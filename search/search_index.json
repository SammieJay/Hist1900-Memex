Coming of age in the presence of the internet, and with parents who never did so themselves, definitely had a role in shaping who I am today.

Now, the internet is a place where you can find just about any kind of community, as you might expect from a system with this level of complexity. As I learned more about how the internet as a physical system developed, it started to help me understand how internet culture started to develop alongside it. It added context to the less savoury sides of the internet that I never really had. If you'd like to hear more about how the internet has shaped the current political landscape and my thoughts on it, I recommend reading my note on Our Age of Misinormation.  I wasn't able to include it here as it's slightly off-topic for what I typically wrote about, but I recommend reading it nonetheless.

It's been a major component in broadening people's understanding of culture and living conditions across the globe. As I learned about the power of the Internet in this regard, I started looking back on events like George Floyd's death and how it would never have had the same impact without such a connected world. Even on a smaller scale, looking at how people started sharing recordings of police officers and the crimes they continue to commit.

But as I read more about what happened, I found a story of a community that fought for their right to exist. Typically, when people online push for change, it's unlikely that anything will come of it. Yet in the case of Geocities, Yahoo complied. Geocities is a window into what the internet could have been, a flourishing and colourful community free to do as they pleased. Sadly, since the Haunting of Geocities, things have only gotten worse for freedom of expression on the Internet.</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_1/#corporate-rule-on-the-internet","title":"Corporate Rule On The Internet","text":"<p>Corporate Rule On the Internet</p> <p>After writing about the fate of Geocities, and how Greed &amp; Capitalism have been driving forces in the creation and cultural development of the Internet, I was starting to feel resentment. Resentment towards companies for holding the internet back from what it could have been, for attempting to squeeze profit out of online users. I learned about the legislation passed in the 1990s that aimed to control and bend the Internet into submission, without understanding what made it such a special place to begin with.

With the current state of Twitter especially, it's easy to see enshitification setting in. Under the supervision of Elon Musk the company is desperate to find monetization opportunities for the site. Other media companies aren't far behind.

From news media to Facebook, to the Twitter feed of prominent politicians, people lie on the internet (shocker, I know). From my research in this course, I've interestingly been able to draw multiple lines of logic as to how things got to be this way. </p> <p>It may have started with hyperlinks. I'm not even kidding, the hyperlink as we know it is very basic and robust compared to early propositions. Many of the first propositions had ways to backlink. This would have allowed any site that had a link going to it, to retroactively link back to what was citing it. I believe that choosing such a simple model for hyperlinks led to a less research minded user base online, if people could see sources in much more detail, perhaps we wouldn't have this issue.</p> <p>As well, many groups online feel censored and excluded from mainstream discussion because of the way content moderation currently happens online. In the 1990s, it was decided that each platform would be held accountable for all content posted to the platform. This corporate centred moderation meant that most mainstream websites will not currently allow certain particularly controversial opinions or values to be voiced on their platform. That means that people get banned and have to search for alternative places to voice their opinion.  These moderation laws have resulted in immense numbers of echo chambers and confirmation bias centred algorithms, which have driven people down misinformation rabbit holes from hell.</p> <p>On top of all of this, algorithms for content platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook, all prioritize content that the user is familiar with as this will tend to increase engagement from the user. This heavily motivates confirmation bias, as the user is unlikely to see anything challenging their current viewpoint. It's profit driven business models like that of Facebook that I blame most for the misinformation crisis of today.</p> <p>This has to change, yet I have little hope that it will.</p>"},{"location":"Notes%20%26%20Thoughts/Our%20Age%20of%20Misinormation/#related-links","title":"Related Links","text":"<p>@shipmanSpatialHypertextAlternative1999</p> <p>An example of an alternative to hypertext</p> <p>@dickersonWhatMakesInternet2009</p> <p>A look at content moderation online and the legislation around it</p> <p>Corporate Rule On the Internet</p> <p>Profit driven decision-making is ruining the internet, here's why</p> <p>This Place Rules (Documentary)</p> <p>A documentary I highly recommend about how the media and internet echo chambers led up to the January 6 Capital Riot by Andrew Callaghan</p> <p>@CaufieldBush2015 (Another Memex)</p> <p>A colleagues' research note on how information is spread online and how it's seen mostly by those who agree with it</p>"},{"location":"Notes%20%26%20Thoughts/The%20Downsides%20of%20Distance%20Work/","title":"The Downsides of Distance Work","text":"<p>Title: The Downsides Of Distance Work date: {{2023-3-20}} type: literature project: memex 2</p> <p>tags:: #connectivity #technology #work #culture #capitalism #greed </p> <p>Ever since the pandemic, companies have been pushing people to work from home, this is often framed as a positive thing.

In the modern age of connectivity, companies have been pushing more people out of the workplace to work remotely, not only is this a cost-effective move on the part of the company as they need not rent out as much office space, but they also get to offer the promise of working from home which many people find appealing (perhaps until they actually try it). The authors make many interesting points as to how remote work can be improved, but my main takeaway was that the internet was never meant as a foundation for collaborative work. It's best when remote work is used as a tool as opposed to the foundation of a company. Face to face (collocative) work has many things that are currently impossible for remote workers, such as the ability to receive quick \"over the shoulder\" feedback and support, limited bandwidth can cause plenty of issues, and cultural differences between workers can seriously affect productivity to name a few.  Another key takeaway from this article is that in some ways, space-time as we talk about it in this course will never die. There will always be ways that humans must interact face-to-face that the internet (in its current scope) cannot simulate. And with work taking up a very significant portion of our existence as humans, it's extremely important that we work around this issue together to make work more comfortable and productive for everybody.</p>"},{"location":"Source%20Notes/%40olsonDistanceMatters2000/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>The Downsides of Distance Work</p> <p>Elaborating on this topic</p> <p>Greed &amp; Capitalism</p> <p>exlpoitative forces and how they affect the internet</p>"},{"location":"Source%20Notes/%40quevedoTelecommunicationsColonialRivalry2010/","title":"@quevedoTelecommunicationsColonialRivalry2010","text":"<p>Title: [@quevedoTelecommunicationsColonialRivalry2010] date: {{3/13/2023}} type: reference project: Memex 2</p> <p>tags: #culture #history #progress #language  Media as Historical Subjects</p>"},{"location":"Source%20Notes/%40quevedoTelecommunicationsColonialRivalry2010/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Quevedo, JM. 2010 Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry: European Telegraph Cables to the Canary Islands and Northwest Africa, 1883-1914.
