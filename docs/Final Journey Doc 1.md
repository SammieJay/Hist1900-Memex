# The Final Journey

### Starting Our Journey

I joined this class thinking I'd learn the ins and outs of how the internet came to be. I'll be leaving with much more than that in ways I didn't expect. One of the important notes to me in my early reading was about how growing up around the internet affected me and the rest of my generation.


### Growing Up With The Internet

I find it fitting that my first note on this journey is about growing up. Coming of age in the presence of the internet, and with parents who never did so themselves, definitely had a role in shaping who I am today. As the course went on, my focus started to shift from the technical aspects of internet history, toward the effects of the internet on our culture and the culture of the internet itself.

### Connectivity & Culture

As the internet grew, it went from a tight nit community to an expansive web of endless nooks and crannies. Now, the internet is a place where you can find just about any kind of community, as you might expect from a system with this level of complexity. As I learned more about how the internet as a physical system developed, it started to help me understand how internet culture started to develop alongside it. It added context to the less savoury sides of the internet that I never really had. If you'd like to hear more about how the internet has shaped the current political landscape and my thoughts on it, I recommend reading my note on [[Our Age of Misinormation]].  I wasn't able to include it here as it's slightly off-topic for what I typically wrote about, but I recommend reading it nonetheless. This us into talking about how the internet has played a role in the fight against oppressive powers.

### The Internet Vs Oppression

The Internet is a communication system that has a global reach. It's been a major component in broadening people's understanding of culture and living conditions across the globe. As I learned about the power of the Internet in this regard, I started looking back on events like George Floyd's death and how it would never have had the same impact without such a connected world. Even on a smaller scale, looking at how people started sharing recordings of police officers and the crimes they continue to commit. Demonstrated to me the power that the internet holds in shaping the world we currently live in.

### The Haunting Of Geocities

We learned about the fate of Geocities in class, an expressive and creative community ravaged by a corporate buyout. But as I read more about what happened, I found a story of a community that fought for their right to exist. Typically, when people online push for change, it's unlikely that anything will come of it. Yet in the case of Geocities, Yahoo complied. Geocities is a window into what the internet could have been, a flourishing and colourful community free to do as they pleased. Sadly, since the Haunting of Geocities, things have only gotten worse for freedom of expression on the Internet.

### Corporate Rule On The Internet

After writing about the fate of Geocities, and how [[Greed & Capitalism]] have been driving forces in the creation and cultural development of the Internet, I was starting to feel resentment. Resentment towards companies for holding the internet back from what it could have been, for attempting to squeeze profit out of online users. I learned about the legislation passed in the 1990s that aimed to control and bend the Internet into submission, without understanding what made it such a special place to begin with. All this led me to write a note that's honestly just me being upset over the current state of the Internet.
