3/22/2023

### The Internet is Evolving
- 1983 - ARPANET switches to TC/ICP
	- MILNET splits off at this point
- 1983 Domain Names system devised
- 1984 comes into effect: gov, .mil, .edu, .org, .net, and .com
- 1986 NSF backbone is built
	- NSF like DCA before it, limits use to approved uses
	- It also decides to use TC/ICP
- 1987 over 10,000 hosts not on 'the internet'
- 1988 comercial email allowed to be transported over NSFNet
	- commercialisation of tat infrastructure begins
	- Senator Al Gore becomes interested in networks for research
- 1990 ARPANet shuts down
- 1991 Gore proposes, and sees through, the High Performance Computing Act
	- This is the 'information superhighway' financing bill
	- amongs other things this funds the team the builds the first webbrowser (Mosaic 1993 evolves into netscape)
- 1991 web comes into existence
- 1993 explodes into popular immagination

### Early Viral Tech
- The first viruses and worms were mostly written as experiements
	- viruses need a host program
	- worms function as their own program
- Creeper - designed by Bob Thomas at BBN
	- designed to copy itself onto connected computers 
	- The first worm
- 1971 IM THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN
- Reaper - designed by Ray Thomlinson, to seek out and eliminate Creeper in 1972
- The Morris Worm 1988
	- within 24 hours 1/10th of connected machines are infected
- the 1980s sees a growing awareness of 'connected computing'
	- we see Terminator & WarGames
-  [2000 worldwide virus ILOVEYOU virus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/tech/iloveyou-virus-computer-security-intl-hnk/index.html)

### Pre Hypertext Systems
- While everyone in the 70s and 80s was occupied with networking, and protocols, and whatnot, another group is more focused on the organisation of information on the web
- Ted Nelson, Xanadu
	- Coins the word 'hypertext'
	- never built
	- [Demo](https://xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html)
- A pattern language, per Maggie Appleton helps us approach questions like:
	- How do you structure information as relationships between peices of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?
	- How to build systems that allow collaboration on shared documents without losing authorship, and how do we credit/compensate authors based on their contributions
	- How do we bring Ideas and data from various sources, into your own work while leaving a clear trail back to the origin
- Parralel Documents & Visible Links
	- [[Parralel Documents and Visual Links.JPG]]
- Nelson: "HTML is precicely what we were tryng to PREVENT - ever-breaking links, links going ouward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management"
	- Thought: did the mass adoptation of HTML influence the misinformation crisis we are currently facing?
- Microcosm
	- 1986 BBC produces a new Doomsday Book - on laser disc
	- interactive explorations, with links and a pointer!
		- [demo from 1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF9oAwUgmKo&ab_channel=zemediatube)
	- Inspiration for Wendy Hall, U Southampton
- Intermedia
	- Connected 5 applications into a scholar's workstation
		- Nicole Yankelovich
		- Nancy Garrett
		- Karen Caitlin
	- Apple yoinks elements from this design
- Sun Microsystems - Link service, developed by Amy Pearl
- Symbolics - Document Examiner by Janet Walker
- Xerox - Cathy Marshal
	- subsequently develops Aquanet and Viki - 1984
	- very similar product becomes bundled with Apple in 1987, 'HyperCard'

### The Start Of Hypertext
- Starting in Europe Tim Berners brings forward a proposal
	- pages connected by links
		- all one way
		- links are not aware
		- and that is it
		- just points at a document
		- This paper is rejected because it's pretty simple
		- Brings it into the demo section though
		- [The Proposal](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html)
	- The main push for Berner's model was that it used the internet to link to documents found on other computers
	- People were not impressed at the conference
	- It was a very basic system but it was simple and connected computers to eachother
- Hypertext was brought up for its simplicity and the easy abilty to implement it
- Clare Evans: 
  "Today, we mostly think of hypertext as being something related to the Web, rather than of the Web as a technically inferior manifestation of hypertext principles"
- MOSAIC is released in 1993 along with CERN open sources web protocols

For all intents and purposes the Web is born!
