### Introduction

traditional textiles were hard to make

flax was starting to be used early in the first millenium

linnen and silk were awfully expencive and was first made about 2700 years ago in eastern China

No one technology exists in a vacum
each of the technologies involved in making silk required the presence of others
Silk is a very high demand material as it's crazy strong

The silk road arose from this industry

The mediteranian was the soul of the silk industry (at least in consumption)


Romans started trying to improve looms and the technology around them as silk was in such demand
*the process needed to be sped up*

### Jacques de Vaucanson
- Very much invested in automata
  (autocratic robot toys)
- wanted to improve the loom
- decided to try making programmable looms that would use a music box - like deisgn (these didn't really catch on unfortunately)

### Joseph-Marie Jacquard
- a counter revolutionary (Monarchist scum)
- As an inventor he found inspiriation (at least he says he did) to become a revolutionary
- son died fighting for revolution so Jacquard left
- After the revolutions sucseeded there was change ushering in change in the form of rationality which was seen as the oposite of Monarchy (the pendulum swings)
- "what is more rational than a machine" -Jacquard (probably)
- raised enough money from weavers to experiment with improving the loom
- patented a loom in 1801 with foot pedals
- exibited at Napoleons expo and wins some coin and prizes
- wins money again for improving fishing nets with the loom
- is now able to make a more programmable and controllable loom
- Automated so that if you have cards threaded together you can go quite fast and also replicate the deign
- for the first time you had a lot more controll over the individual strands of silk
- this was *The Jacquard Loom* 
- It used punchcards to program the behavior therefore it is an exremely early example of *Programmable Memory*

### Punch Cards
- Jacquard did not invent the punch card
- Louis Faucon/Falcon was the first to do that with looms but Jacquard was the most influential

### Why do we care about Jacquard?
- when he came along the peices were all there, ready for the taking to be put together
- The technology existed so if Jacquard didn't do it someone else would have
- 4 words: **Programmable, External, Mechanical, Memory** that is why we care
- the real innovation was the cards, NOT the loom

### Charles Babbage and the Difference Machine
- Babbage a brilliant well to do mathematician, did the tables himself
- he proposed a potential to automate the calculation of differences in tables, the government funded him heavily, and yet he never finished it
- Only ever built 1/7th of the machine and then brought it around to show off
- he then realised that punch cards was the better way to go, tried to pitch that, and was told to finish the first one. Never finished the machine.
- Puch cards were not forgotten though...


### Ada Lovelace (Girlboss Queen)
- *"We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebreic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves"* - Ada Lovelace

We'll come back to Lovelace and Babbage, they're important (especially that girlboss Ada)

Coupling puch cards with electro mechanical counting sets in train the development of the digital computer... we'll come back to

When computers evertually started getting pitched to buisness is when shit rly took off
