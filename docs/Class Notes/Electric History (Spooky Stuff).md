# Electric History
### Electricity in Nature
- Mushrooms talk via electrical current
- Similar to how we do with synapses
- Electric Eels and some kinds of Catfish use electricity
- "Inherant Animal Electricity"
	- An Italian scientist named Galvani found out that applying electrical currents to frog nerves moved the leg muscles
	- This inherent electrical interaction would spark intrest

### Early Medicicne
- in early medicine there was a need for human corpses
	- These were sourced through criminal corpses, and bodies of people that had little to no family
- A man was hung
	- Shortly after hanging, electrical currents were applied to the body causing it to move and flop around a little (this was a public demonstration, 1800's stuff fr)
	- This was so spooky (spooky stuff) that one of the medical "proffesionals" present dropped dead out of fear (apparently
- Frankenstein and the thought of "electrical soul"
	- The discovery of electricity and it's relation to the body led to the writing of Frankenstein
	- It was thought that electricity had something to do with the life force of a person (what made them alive)

### Static Electricity
- The greeks discovered that amber could hold static electricity very well
	- They didn't know what it was but they knew it made a zappy when rubbed with wool
- This scientist guy Pete did an experiment and basically made an early capacitor (his assistant got a big zap)
- Another experiment basically had 200 people to stand in a big circle holding conductive rods and found how quickly a static shock would travel the circle (which it did basically instantaneously)

### More Early Electrical Experiments
- in the 1800s one of the first batteries was made and we started to be able to use prolonged current as we see it today
- Hans Christian Orsted
	- worked out that electric current in a nearby wire will deflect a compas needle
	- he worked out that electric current produces a circular magnetic field
- Micheal Faraday (cage boi)
	- Found out that you can reverse what my boy Hans found out and that you can make current with magnets
- Joseph Henry
	- With a mile and a half long peice of wire Mr Henry was able to ring a bell on the other end with electricity
	- He had discovered the relay
	- This has collapsed spacetime, and we can now send messages pretty much instantly across crazy distances

### Telegraphs
- Imediately after Joseph Henry's discovery work on long distance communication began immediately
- There was work to be done on figuring out how to get current over very long distances
- The government didn't wanna fund this because you know, government be governing
- The opportunity for controlling trains and making sure they don't collide was very nice

### The Pieces Are In Place
- We Can:
	- Store electricity
	- induce electricity to travel
	- induce changes in some device at point B by altering current at point A
	- and because we know magnetic fields and electricity are connected, we can easily move compas needles with electricity

- This is the end, but just for now
