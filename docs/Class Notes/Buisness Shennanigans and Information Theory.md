### Graham Bell and his Buisness Adventures
tags: #bell 
- At The end of the 19th century 'networks' were not a novel idea
-  Gas, Water, Sewer, and Electical netorks were appearing
- Graham Bell did some dweelings
- Bell envisioned an entire connected network could communicate with eachother by mouth (telphony)
- First Bell company was founded in 1875

-  In 1884 American Bell establishes a long distance line between NY and Boston
	- This is the origin of AT&T
	- bell made the company specifically to manage this long distance line
	- They also establish a laboratory to improve long distance telephony
	- In 1888 - all the court battles around the origonal patents were won by Bell
- Bell is making MAD money (three dollar signs) even though the entirety of the rest of the economy is in shambles (capitalism moment)
- too bad these patents were about to expire :o
### Bell was buying out the competition (man where have I heard that one before)
### Long distance telephony was central to Bell's plan to survive the expiration of it's patents (monopolization)

## Bell's Capitalistic Greed
- The plan was to monopolize long distance telephony
-  aiming for total controll of telephony 
### Not everyone wanted a telephone at first, remember in Downton Abbey
- Not super reliable
- The system was killed at one point by *The Carrington Event*
- Electrical interference was common because of trolleys, storms, and whatnot
## Bell in Wartime
- Even durring wartime Bell labs allowed their researchers to basically research whatever they want
- Someone in bell labs was working on firing systems for the war founded information theory
### The foundations of AND, OR, and NOT were made in this lab in 1938
- The idea of using electrical signals to do truth tests was born (the logical circuit was created)
- Logical operations are the foundations of computers today
### While trying to isolate electrical noise they found a way to quantify telephone signals
- Claude Shannon in 1948 took this Idea and developed a way to think about a message as being composed of two things
	- The content
	- The information
- Information is a measurement of the redundancy of that content, or how 'suprising' the next letter/sound/wave is
### Combine informational theory
- the division of a message from its meaning - with logical circuits you get the 20th century

# Automatic Exchanges
- Before automatic exchangers we had Opperators who would manually move the line to the propper port
- The Strowger automatic exchange was ivented in 1892 because some guy named Strowger was tired of the opperator connecting people to competing buisnesses
- It would be more than 2 decades before the exchange started to be widely implemented
- A device for turning a weak current into a strong current
