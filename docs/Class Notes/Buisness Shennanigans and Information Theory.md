### Graham Bell and his Business Adventures

- At The end of the 19th century 'networks' were not a novel idea
-  Gas, Water, Sewer, and Electrical networks were appearing
- Graham Bell did some dealings
- Bell envisioned an entire connected network could communicate with each other by speech (telephony)
- First Bell company was founded in 1875
-  In 1884 American Bell establishes a long distance line between NY and Boston
	- This is the origin of AT&T
	- bell made the company specifically to manage this long distance line
	- They also establish a laboratory to improve long distance telephony
	- In 1888 - all the court battles around the original patents were won by Bell
- Bell is making MAD money (three dollar signs) even though the entirety of the rest of the economy is in shambles (capitalism moment)
	- too bad these patents were about to expire :o
	- Bell was buying out the competition (man where have I heard that one before)
	- Long distance telephony was central to Bell's plan to survive the expiration of its patents (monopolization)

### Bell's Capitalistic Greed
- The plan was to monopolize long distance telephony
-  aiming for total control of telephony 
- Not everyone wanted a telephone at first, remember in Downton Abbey
	- Not super reliable
	- The system was killed at one point by *The Carrington Event*
	- Electrical interference was common because of trolleys, storms, and whatnot

### Bell in Wartime
- Even during wartime Bell labs allowed their researchers to basically research whatever they want
- Someone in bell labs was working on firing systems for the war founded information theory
- The foundations of AND, OR, and NOT were made in this lab in 1938
	- The idea of using electrical signals to do truth tests was born (the logical circuit was created)
	- Logical operations are the foundations of computers today
	- While trying to isolate electrical noise they found a way to quantify telephone signals

### Combine informational theory
- Claude Shannon in 1948 took this Idea and developed a way to think about a message as being composed of two things
	- The content
	- The information
- Information is a measurement of the redundancy of that content, or how 'suprising' the next letter/sound/wave is
- the division of a message from its meaning - with logical circuits you get the 20th century

### Automatic Exchanges
- Before automatic exchangers there were operators who would manually move the line to the proper port
- The Strowger automatic exchange was invented in 1892 because some guy named Strowger was tired of the operator connecting people to competing businesses
- It would be more than 2 decades before the exchange started to be widely implemented
- A device for turning a weak current into a strong current
