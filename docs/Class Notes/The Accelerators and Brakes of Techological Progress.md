- Theory is so epic and cool (Prof. Shawn Grahm is on the brink somebody help him)

- Semaphores were an existing form of quick communication when the telegraph was invented
	- This created reluctance to adopt the telegraph as semephores had already had so much invested in them
	- Introducing, the stock market

- Companies start to make morse networks
	- Henry O'Reilley gets right to use the Morse patents (Morse will regret this)
	- Competing services and companies string lines side-by-side
	- Companies start to realise the non-profitability of this industry (for the time being)
	- Eventaully Morse is triumphant in the courts and regains sole controll of his patents

EXTENDING THE WIRES

- The Morse Court Battles
	-  plenty of vandalism and line cutting happened at the time
	- By 1851, Morse won and the ownership and operation of the telegraph lines were consolidated
	- only 3 companies still standing at this point
	- by the end of the 1860s, only Western Union is still around
	- >150 companies absorbed
	- Tens of Thousands of miles of cable, and thousands of telegraph offices owned by Western Union
-  International Telegraphy
	- 1842 - Morse runs a cable under NewYork harbor to try it out
	 - 1852 - a cable is laid between New Brunswik and PEI
	 - 1858 - The first trans-Atlantic cable is laid
		-  Getting the cable onto the ship took 3 weeks alone
		 - Crazy heavy cable
		 - No repeater stations
		 - after 300 Miles, the cable snaps and they gotta start again
		 - A second attempt failed as well
		 - On the 3rd attempt it worked
		 - The telegraph cable was working for all of 3 weeks
		 - They find a scapegoat in someone who put 2k volts into the cable to get a better signal
		 - it was later found that it didn't really matter cause it was a pretty shoddy cable
	- 1858 - an inventor creates a way to visualise the feint electrical pulse
	- Then the american civil war happens
	- Space on a global scale has been anihilated by this feat
	- Things take off from here

IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPERIALISM
- it was a concern that imperialism would become more of a problem with the ability to communicate quickly
	- This was important to the rush for africa
	- Occupation of India is affected by the introduction of the telegraph and it's networks
- Latex production
	- only accesible from a specific kind of tree back then
	- made from Gutta-Percha
	- Without this resource there are no undersea cables
	- the number of trees destroyed went close to 88 Million
	- This tree went extinct in many places because of the cable demand

It's not too long until the telephone starts to take shape
