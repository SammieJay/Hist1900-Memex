### The Rise Of Google
- coming out of the 90s the web was seen as a space to explore, a place to see, this is no longer today but we're not quite there yet
- One man saw the internet mathematically and started to see how backlinks to sources could be useful
	- he started logging this with a web crawler
	- these links were prioritized by an algorithm (as many things are nowadays)
	- indexed 60 MILLION pages taking up 40% of stanford's bandwidth
	- getting lots of positive mentions
	- offered 1 mil for the program
	- messed it up and didn't sell
- A company is made and startup money is running out
	- Google started runnng ads and in 5 years ended up going from a valuation of 1 mil to 5 BILLION
	- data is being dumped into the algorithm for advertising and returns are coming fast
- by 2004 the .com boom has creasted
- google has it's IPO in 2004
	- valued at 52 Billion Dollars
- Writers and Artists vs Content Creators #art
	- motivation to monitize
	- Making money for a platform by making content that the platform you are making content for will push
- Google is commiting greed and capitalism (who could have forseen this!?)
- Early framing of google was democractic in favor of the algorithmic nature of the site

### Concequences of Google
- abandoned sites
	- some websites didnt have many links to them and therefore were often looked over and never got traffic
	- the rich get richer type beat
	- Hubs are easier to navigagte to and so they get pushed by google
- The loop of better linked to pages getting more traffic then being linked to even more because of it is a powerful one

	- Visibility of minorities may not be as equal as we think
- Google likes to fire ethics team members these days for some reason
