# The 90s And Their Significance

3/27/2023
### The Rise of the Browser
- The browser emerges with MOSAIC
- Next we get NETSCAPE
- Then we get WINDOWS '95
- It was at this point that the browser starts being able to do so much more than just browse webpages
	- Can check email
- Microsoft is gunning for NETSCAPE
- All the browsers kinda look the same
- The companies want a healthy userbase before finding profits
- Netscape is losing to microsoft because windows is bundling internet explorer
- A bit later we start to see some buletin board services that frame themselves as 'portals'
- The idea that people can have their own space on the web
	- [Shoelace Site]([https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/))
	- You would need hosting
- Internet Gopher was paid so people wouldnt use is rly
- The internet was becoming a place other than a utility

### Geocities
- geocities was shifting the perspective from a space to consume content to a space to create
- went from 10,000 users in 1995 to 1,000,000 users in 1997
- Geocities was like a board to post your own website
- Yahoo picked up the site and killed all the geographic metaphors in 2002
	- They also pretty much killed off the site
	- The ruins are still acessible because of backwards compatibility
- Community Leaders Emerge
	- Community leaders are volunteers that do hard work
	- they gave out badges and awards, and generally kept a positive vibe

### Section 230
- wat if someone put up something noxious on a website tha tyou were operating a server for
- "Think of the children"
- "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider" (47 U.S.C sec 230(c)(1))
- A case happens where it is decided that sites are liable for content on their website which means that if you try and moderate at all, you are liable for what you dont catch. That's why the above clause was added
	- That shii didn't work tho (because of course it didnt the internet finds a way
	- The law applied regardless of how much content moderation gets done, but lots of people treat is as if it does.
	- From this 4chan, 8chan, and Gamergate would be born
