# Welcome
## Hello There!

I appreciate you taking the time to come visit my memex! Durring my time with HIST1900c *History of the Internet* I've taken some notes (some more coherent than others), and this is a place where I have organised and furthered my exploration into the history of the massive informational system we call the internet and how it came to be. Feel free to look around, but I recommend starting with the [[Jumping Off Point]] page!

I hope you enjoy your time here, and maybe even learn something along the way !

The `index.md` in the `/docs` folder is the homepage you see here.

The folders in `/docs` appear as the main sections on the navigation bar.

The notes appear as pages within these sections. For example, in `Topic 1`
