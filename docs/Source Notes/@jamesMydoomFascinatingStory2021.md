### Summary & Key Take Aways

This piece talks about the fastest spreading computer virus/worm in human history. It was able to spread so quickly because of how it took advantage of humans as opposed to computer systems. Back in 2004 people had yet to develop a sense of skepticism and caution with the internet (some still have yet to do so). By disguising itself as an email with a download link, the virus quickly spread to 50 million computers worldwide (some still infected to this day). The story of this virus stands as a testament to how people are often the weakest link in our connected system.
