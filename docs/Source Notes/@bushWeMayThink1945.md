### Summary & Key Take Aways

Discussions and predictions on the direction of information technology from the perspective of someone in 1945. Bush is talking about how technology is affecting the people of his time. He explains his idea of a memex and what that might look like in the future. And while I admire his optimism, I think Bush failed to realise the potential chaos that such interconnectedness might bring to a society.
