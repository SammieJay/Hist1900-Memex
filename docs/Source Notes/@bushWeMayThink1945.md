### Summary & Key Take Aways

Discussions and predictions on the direction of information technology from the perspective of someone in 1945. Bush is talking about how technology is affecting the people of his time. He explains his idea of a memex and what that might look like in the future. Bush is very optimistic about the level of organization and standardization that may come from the internet. In reality, the internet became much more of a messy web of resources, entertainment, and communications. 

Bush is almost "coining" the idea of the Memex here. The idea of an individual's research all being placed into the same repertoire, that repertoire being their memex. He envisioned a way for research to be intensely interconnected, but in the current world of competition and capitalism most research is done privately and is not often done in a collaborative spirit in the way Bush envisioned.
