### Summary & Key Take Aways

Tworek describes how WWI brought about progression in the way of wireless technology that lasted into WWII. Understanding how radio and wireless communication came about and was developed is important to understanding why we use it today. For if it had not come about in wartime, then we may very well be looking at a very different system for wireless communication.
