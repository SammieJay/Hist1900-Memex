### Summary & Key Take Aways

Here Kittler goes into media, and it's past and how it's relevant to us. He describes the evolution of paper, printing, telegraphy, and computing in understandable and manageable ways. Understanding how information systems emerged, and its history, is something we talk about a lot in this course. Kittler shows how information systems and communication systems differ, with one having memory and algorithm based processing, while communication systems do not.
