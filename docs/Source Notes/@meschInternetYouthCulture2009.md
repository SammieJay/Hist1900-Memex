### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article is one that I relate to heavily, having grown up in and around the internet. Mesch is dissecting an important part of my early years and is making connections to the larger world. He wants the reader to understand the effects and consequences that growing up with the internet has on youth. Mesch explains that the internet is not simply "rotting the brains of the kids" as some say, but that the effects that unlimited connection have on development are much more nuanced and deserve to be studied as such. Mesch provides interesting ideas on how people should go about learning youth and internet culture. I grew up with everything from VHS, to iPods, to landlines and cell phones, all this change has a significant effect on a child and Mesch has done a good job of explaining it.
