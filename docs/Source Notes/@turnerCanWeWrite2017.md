### Summary & Key Take Aways

Turner here is taking a deep look into how the construction of such an advanced and interconnected system such as the internet affects the culture and people who connect with it. Turner explains how the fact that there is such connection in a society affects the way people view the world around them. When people are better able to record and document the way they live and so easily share it of course it's going to change the view of how they live.
