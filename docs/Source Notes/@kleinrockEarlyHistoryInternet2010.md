### Summary & Key Take Aways

Kleinrock was an early developer of the internet and in this article he describes his work and his journey in bringing about what we have today. He describes the creation of the ARPANET, which many consider to be the first version of the internet. Kleinrock explains however, that the history of the early internet is not as simple as 'it started with the ARPANET' and I would agree. He makes sure that the reader unsderstand the sheer ammound of people and time that went into the modern Internet. And that is one of my key takaways for this course in general.
