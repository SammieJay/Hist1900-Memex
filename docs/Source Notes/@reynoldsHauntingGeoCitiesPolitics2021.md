### Summary & Key Take Aways

^2b0554

Geocities was an expressive and wholesome internet website making community. Then the fire nation attacked (meaning Yahoo bought the company). Yahoo, having concerns about being potentially prosecuted over site content, was about to impose much harsher terms of service on Geocities which would give Yahoo a lot of control over the site's content. This was the spark that caused one of the most notable strikes or "hauntings" in internet history. ^65707a

In mass, Geocities users stripped their sites of content and colour, to post images of the new terms of service being imposed by Yahoo. This was intended to take away the profit potential of Geocities, hitting Yahoo where it hurts. Low and behold, after a while Yahoo caved. They ended up changing the terms of service twice, to better suit the users of Geocities. This marks one of the few rare examples of an internet community fighting for what they deserve, and actually getting it. ^b43456
