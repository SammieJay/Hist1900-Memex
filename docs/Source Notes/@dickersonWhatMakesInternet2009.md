### Summary & Key Take Aways

Dickerson discusses how in past internet content has been moderated, the potential for first amendment right infringement, and what content moderation on the internet should look like. Dickerson brings a legal perspective to his writing and hopes to help us understand how moderation should look on the internet and how it has gone awry. For being written in 2009 the article is surprisingly relevant.

In the current day, there are many people calling into question if corporations have the right to decide who can speak and what they can say on their platforms. In the current day, it's mostly right wing minded individuals wanting to speak their mind on sensitive topics that are an advocate for less censorship online. While their opinions may sometimes be hateful, it's worth considering the moral and legal repercussions of not allowing their opinions in digital spaces. Dickerson describes the original legislation put in place in the 1990s and how it created the environment we are currently in. How control was left to corporations and what that means for the internet's user base. After reading I can confidently say that the laws on content moderation were rushed, and led to many problems for us today.
