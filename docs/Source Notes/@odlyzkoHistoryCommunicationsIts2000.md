### Summary & Key Take Aways

The internet was built in service of those who use it, Odlyzko seeks to explain why it's important that the internet remains in service of the user. He looks into uses and effects of information networks to search for recurring patterns and what they mean. While this topic is very broad, Odylkzo focuses mostly on what is important and what benefits the users of these networks.
