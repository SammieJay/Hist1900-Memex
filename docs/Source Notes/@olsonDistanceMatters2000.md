### Summary & Key Take Aways

This is likely my favourite reading to date, Olsen and Olsen delve into how present day distance work is often flawed in its implementation and what strides can be made to fix it. In the modern age of connectivity, companies have been pushing more people out of the workplace to work remotely, not only is this a cost-effective move on the part of the company as they need not rent out as much office space, but they also get to offer the promise of working from home which many people find appealing (perhaps until they actually try it). The authors make many interesting points as to how remote work can be improved, but my main takeaway was that the internet was never meant as a foundation for collaborative work. It's best when remote work is used as a tool as opposed to the foundation of a company.
Face to face (collocative) work has many things that are currently impossible for remote workers, such as the ability to receive quick "over the shoulder" feedback and support, limited bandwidth can cause plenty of issues, and cultural differences between workers can seriously affect productivity to name a few. 
Another key takeaway from this article is that in some ways, space-time as we talk about it in this course will never die. There will always be ways that humans must interact face-to-face that the internet (in its current scope) cannot simulate. And with work taking up a very significant portion of our existence as humans, it's extremely important that we work around this issue together to make work more comfortable and productive for everybody.
