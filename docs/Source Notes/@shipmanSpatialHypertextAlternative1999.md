### Summary & Key Take Aways

Hypertext is absolutely crucial to how we navigate the internet today, in fact it's the only way that we do so. Hypertext works by sending the user to a specified address when you click on it. As discussed in class, this is extremely simple and this could have been so much more. Systems proposed for hypertext could have had back linking to the source, visual components, and many more advanced ways of net navigation. Here, Shipman explores a way of visually mapping hypertext onto a directional graph, allowing the user to navigate in a much more broad and visually oriented manner.

With a visual map, the user could navigate the internet in a much more intuitively visual way than we do now. For instance, they could go down a branch of the graph and find content on more and more specific topics. Or they could choose nodes near to each other that aren't actually linked to each other but have similar subject matter It's unfortunate that this was never implemented, maybe we can work together to improve the hypertext system in future.
