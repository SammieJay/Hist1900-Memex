# Final Journey (Pt.2)

### My Goal From The Start
At the start of the course we were asked what we wanted to learn. What I said was; "I'd like to learn more of how the internet became what it is now. I spend so much time with it, Iâ€™d like to know how it became what it is". I'd say that I've not only achieved this goal, but exceeded it.

### An Early History Of The Internet

While in this course, we started with the earliest forms of documented information, most of my research was centred on events post-Arpanet. From this note, I learned about the physical beginnings of the Internet we know today. This was where I somewhat expected the course to start, but was pleasantly surprised to find otherwise.

### Why The ARPANET Was Built

From here I wanted to know more about the motives for building the ARPANET, because at the time of building it was entirely unknown what the ARPANET would eventually become. It turns out (like many technologies before it) the ARPANET was built with militaristic intentions. After this discovery, I started to learn more about [[War Driven Innovation]] and it's effects.

### Sliding Into Hypertext and the Web

One of the topics I found very interesting from class, was potential designs for hypertext and what it could have looked like. There was so much potential for information rich linkages, and yet we seem to have chosen the most boring option. This to me was a bit upsetting, and I wanted to know more.

### Spatial Hypertext as an Alternative to Links
[[@shipmanSpatialHypertextAlternative1999]]

This research note describes an alternative proposition for hypertext. One based on visual representation of information. As I read more I became increasingly upset over the proposition, not because I didn't like it, but because I wished that we had something better than our current system for links. The article described representing the internet as a directional map, where you could navigate visually with branching topics and articles appearing before you. I wanted this form of hypertext, and it made me upset that we never got it.

### Our Age of Misinformation
[[Our Age of Misinormation]]

This note is probably the longest piece of writing in my whole Memex. I had a lot to say about the state of information sharing in our current world, about how information could be presented in so many better ways than we got, and how it's had negative effects on the world we live in. At this point I've gone long past my expectations for the course in multiple subject matters, but there's no doubt in my mind that this was entirely intentional.

### In Conclusion
I went into this course hoping to learn a bit about the physical structures of the internet, and maybe a bit about its sub-cultures. Yet I came away having learned a range of topics from imperialism & capitalism, to the printing press and how misinformation is spread online. It's been quite the journey (*wink*), and I've enjoyed every step of it.
