Enshitification is the degradation of a product. It was used in class to describe how companies will drain a user base of everything they have until they actually just implode (I'm paraphrasing but close enough). It's a blaring example of how corporate entities exploit the internet and it's users for profit, and spit out what's left. It happened to Geocities, it happens with online games, it happens everywhere in capitalist America because that's the goal of a profit driven company, exploit. I'm tired of freemium pay models, I'm tired of data collection, I'm tired of streaming services producing tired, uncreative, and lazy content for me to shove into my brain like potato chips. Maybe one day this will change, but that day is not today.
