As the internet becomes more prevalent in everyday life, we start to trust it more. We collectively have more sensitive information online than ever before, and it's not quite as safe as we'd like to admit. With corporations collecting immensely more data on you than you know, and the constant use of ID, credit cards, and more personal information accessible thought the cloud, we hope that this information is kept safe. Unfortunately, this isn't the case.

Ever since inception, the internet has been exploited in malicious ways (see MyDoom). And ever since the start, people have been trying to find ways of protecting sensitive data. But with a system so convoluted and spread out, with corporations that are incentivized not to care about the safety of your data, sometimes things don't go to plan. We hear massive headlines on data breaches and the like, and so much more can be happening behind consumer's backs that we'd never know about. I have no solution to this problem, all I know is how much it scares me.
