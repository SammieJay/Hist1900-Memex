In the past few thousand years, humans have gone from storing information on clay tablets, to punch cards, to multi-terrabyte capacity solid state drives. This progress has been steady and consistent, it represents human progression accurately, similar to processor density (another common indicator of technological progress). To me this indicates that perhaps our progression forward as a species hinges on our ability to efficiently store, share, and process information.
