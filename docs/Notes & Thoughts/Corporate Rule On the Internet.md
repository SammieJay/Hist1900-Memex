The internet today is pretty much corporately owned, most users visit a few sites, run by a few companies. Hosted on those sites is a wealth of content though, but overseeing all of this content is massive companies all driven solely by profit. It is my opinion that this is what led to the downfall of Geocities as it was bought by Yahoo, how YouTube has started to become a platform for corporate content, and how content moderation is killing artful expression on many sites. 

Since the 1990s content moderation was left up to corporations and the corporate entity will be responsible for all the content on its platform. Not only does this encourage extremely strict content moderation, it means corporations will ban first, ask questions later as not to be caught with infringing content on their platform. This is what led to the haunting of Geocities,  a creative and delightful website making platform from the early internet. Today it is barren. 

Companies have incentives to squeeze as much content from users as possible in the form of user generated content. They are incentivized to ban any content remotely unacceptable to their terms of service. And they are incentivized to screw over their user base for profit. This is not the internet I wish to live in, but I doubt it will ever change.
