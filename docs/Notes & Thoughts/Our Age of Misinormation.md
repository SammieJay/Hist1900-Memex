We live in a time where misinformation is absolutely rampant. From news media to Facebook, to the Twitter feed of prominent politicians, people lie on the internet (shocker, I know). From my research in this course, I've interestingly been able to draw multiple lines of logic as to how things got to be this way. 

It may have started with hyperlinks. I'm not even kidding, the hyperlink as we know it is very basic and robust compared to early propositions. Many of the first propositions had ways to *backlink*. This would have allowed any site that had a link going to it, to retroactively link back to what was citing it. I believe that choosing such a simple model for hyperlinks led to a less research minded user base online, if people could see sources in much more detail, perhaps we wouldn't have this issue.

As well, many groups online feel censored and excluded from mainstream discussion because of the way content moderation currently happens online. In the 1990s, it was decided that each platform would be held accountable for all content posted to the platform. This corporate centred moderation meant that most mainstream websites will not currently allow certain particularly controversial opinions or values to be voiced on their platform. That means that people get banned and have to search for alternative places to voice their opinion.  These moderation laws have resulted in immense numbers of echo chambers and confirmation bias centred algorithms, which have driven people down misinformation rabbit holes from hell.

On top of all of this, algorithms for content platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook, all prioritize content that the user is familiar with as this will tend to increase engagement from the user. This heavily motivates confirmation bias, as the user is unlikely to see anything challenging their current viewpoint. It's profit driven business models like that of Facebook that I blame most for the misinformation crisis of today.

This has to change, yet I have little hope that it will.
