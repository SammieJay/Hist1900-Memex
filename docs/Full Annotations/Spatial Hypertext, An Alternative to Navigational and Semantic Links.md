# Spatial Hypertext: An Alternative to Navigational and Semantic Links
URL: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/345966.346001

The original purpose for Hyperlinks
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Hypertext began as a vision of interconnected reference materials [Bush 1945] and literature [Robertson 1998].These early visions were joined by working systems that supported link-based navigation among documents as wellas branching points within (hyper)documents [Engelbart 1984].[^1]

As discussed in class this never came to fruition. This is close to what we include in our Memexes though
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> As the use of hypertext systems became morewidespread, researchers realized that readers could become confused or lost as they navigated large networks[Conklin 1987a]. Systems such as NoteCards [Halasz 1987] addressed this problem by displaying maps of thehypertext's network structure.[^1]

If only we had backlinking hypertext
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> hypertext maps gave rise tosystems in which the user's main interaction with the hypertext was through a network map rather than a documentviewer.[^1]

Which would be able to backtrack references to the source, making fact checking and citing sources a whole lot easier
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> The move from document-centered hypertext systems to map-based hypertext systems had some unforeseen but far-reaching implications: relationships between nodes could be expressed in more than one way. Maps showedinterconnectedness explicitly, usually in the form of a directed graph.[^1]

Similar subject matter could play a role in distance. This would allow the user to go down a specific branch of the map to find more about a specific topic
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> relationships among different nodes or documents could be indicated simply on the basis of their relative location.[^1]

People like the visual proximity of subjects, maybe future hypertext systems could implement this
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Users avoided the explicit linking mechanisms in favor of the more implicit expression ofrelationships through spatial proximity and visual attributes [Marshall 1992]. Further analysis showed that the use ofthese spatial and visual cues to imply relationships applied not only to map-based hypertext systems, but also totraditional hypertext systems and in the physical arrangement of paper and notecards [Marshall 1993].[^1]

The visual aspect could be extremely helpful in finding sources for research as it would allow for easy searches for articles related to a specific topic
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Given this historical perspective on spatial hypertext and a range of experiences with its use, what can we inferabout the types of activities for which it will be useful?[^1]

So proximity without an actual link would allow users to find material similar to what they're looking at without there being an actual intended link to that material
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Another benefit of spatial hypertext is its facility for constructive ambiguity. Where a link in a document-centeredhypertext either exists or does not in a particular presentation of the material, placement of a node close but not quitewith others can imply some indecision or potential for a relation between the nodes.[^1]

This article being published 24 years ago is sad because this sort of hyperlink system may never see implementation even though it has so many advantages over the current document based system
&mdash;[[]]

> The growth of the Web has led to a growing number of systems that provide "Web workspaces" in which users cancollect, organize, and otherwise work with information. VIKI itself includes a number of interconnections with theWeb including the ability to author presentations containing Web-based information [Shipman 1997].[^1]
