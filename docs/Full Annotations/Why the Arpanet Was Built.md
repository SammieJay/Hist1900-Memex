# Why the Arpanet Was Built
URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432117

Yet to the men working on it, it was somewhat arbitrary. As we've been discussing, the internet was more of a logical progression of technologies than anything else. It was destined to happen because of the technologies that came before it.

The APRPANET was not built because there was a vision for a massive expansive internet. It was much more short sighted than that.

As it became more apparent how useful this technology could be, more resources were invested
&mdash;[[]]

## Source

War driven innovation seems to happen most when the military is like "here's a gazillion dollars, now go make me some cool shit" then people make the military some cool shit

And yet the ARPANET would prove much more influential
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> In 1983, the Arpanet was divided into two parts, a research network that continued to be called Arpanet, and Milnet serving military users. In 1989, the Arpanet was closed down. ARPA's intent had been to demonstrate the utility of packet switching for military command and control, and in that, it succeeded brilliantly.[^1]
