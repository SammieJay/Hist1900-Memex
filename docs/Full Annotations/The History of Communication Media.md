## Page Notes
## Highlights
- What follows is on attempt to discuss the history of communication technologies - as far as this is humanly possible — [Updated on 2023-03-20 19:51:56](https://hyp.is/Mmij4Md6Ee2E_j_k4nN-Rw/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: We goin way back
- One practical problem is that communications technologies themselves are documented to a far lesser extent or are far less accessible than their contents — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:01:58](https://hyp.is/mViqXsd7Ee2xvJ8rKUDxkw/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: I wonder why this is
- Information systems in the narrowest sense of the word are, it is true, optimised in terms of the storage, processing and transmission of messages. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:03:12](https://hyp.is/xYk_Tsd7Ee2sWmdigBh6Yg/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: A good definition
- Information systems in the narrowest sense of the word are, it is true, optimised in terms of the storage, processing and transmission of messages. Communication systems on the other hand because in addition to messages they also control the traffic of persons and goods 3 comprise all kinds of media — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:04:25](https://hyp.is/8Nq2gsd7Ee23o0eOzNUEEg/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: An interesting distinction that I haven't thought about
- Firstly there is an information source which selects one message per unit of time from the either enumerable-discrete or innumerable-continuous quantity of possible messages. Secondly this source supplies one or more transmitters which process the message via suitable coding into a technical signal (something which is quite impossible in the discrete case without intermediate data storage). Thirdly these transmitters feed a channel which safeguards the transmission of the signal in space and/or time from physical noise and/or hostile interference. Fourthly these channels lead to one or more receivers which reconstitute the message from the signal by subjecting it to a decoding algorithm inverse to that of the transmitter, so that finally, Fifthly, the retranslated message arrives at the address of an information drain.7 — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:15:24](https://hyp.is/eXvZrMd9Ee2FlC9-Y_e1DQ/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: A model of how information systems work
- The first series of variables controls developments between speech and writing: degrees of memory performance, degrees of grammatical analysability, the possibilities of coupling speech with other media. As an independent field of anthropological media research it can, for our purposes, be left to one side. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:16:57](https://hyp.is/sRAU-sd9Ee2M7xOdYY76Yw/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: The first externalizations of memory were extremely significant in our progression as a species
- The first manifestations of script are of course inscriptions without a writing surface in the accepted sense. Two-dimensional rolls of seals or stamps in the medium of clay enabled goods to be given addresses indicating their owner or their contents. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:17:43](https://hyp.is/zLneysd9Ee26x0u4HNsIbg/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: early name tags
- Gutenberg's invention of printing using movable letters developed from book-spine stamps which, in contrast to their predecessors in China and Korea, functioned both alphabetically and (after the disappearance of ligatures) discretely, may not have been a revolution of the magnitude of the codex - but it met the demand awakened by paper. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:28:48](https://hyp.is/WRKb4Md_Ee2YYn_j3X-lKg/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: The printing press allowed for the replication and copying of information which significantly improved the usefulness of paper at the time
- As "the first assembly line in the history of technology" 33, printing potentiated the data processing capacity of books. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:29:08](https://hyp.is/ZPbmPMd_Ee2vUR_p8tsw1w/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: The earliest assembly line
- this material basis of all mass print material since 1850, took the place of rag. And finally the typewriter and have, since 1880, levelled out the difference between writing and printing — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:31:33](https://hyp.is/u0Dftsd_Ee2M5rc4tMRUbA/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: physical writing seemingly met it's maximum potential at this point
- Information rates which exceeded all performance limits of writing were first achieved as a result of the necessity for command flow in conscripted mass armies and wars waged with standardised weaponry. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:33:23](https://hyp.is/_JfSxsd_Ee2FpEMGMeG3wQ/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: war used to drive innovation, it still does but now it is mostly privatized and Raytheon just gets to keep all it's fun new toys
- In terms of organisation and technology too, telegraphy had world-wide repercussions. For absolutely the first time, information was decoupled, in the form of a massless flow of electromagnetic waves, from communication. Remote telegraphic control via landline made possible a systematic railway network.52 Railways made possible an accelerated traffic in goods and persons 53 which, from the time of the American Civil War onward, was also subject, for military purposes, to telegraphic command. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:34:35](https://hyp.is/J3x4mMeAEe291QPx3vGhuw/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: It was at this point that the technology in information really started driving industrial innovation
- Bell's telephone, the most lucrative single patent of all time, came about in 1876 not by any means in its familiar function, but in the course of an attempt to transmit several messages over a single telegraph cable at the same time. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:35:23](https://hyp.is/RCXAlMeAEe2CuyOBh-BybA/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: Information density strikes again and gave us the ring ring banana phone (I am delirious)
- Stone inscriptions named the deceased occupants of tombs.16 As signals in the absence of the sou — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:42:14](https://hyp.is/OS5_NseBEe2TCZ9iX6hBSg/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023

- Film and gramophone, these mass-reproducible competitors to Edison's phonographs, made it possible to store optical and acoustical data as such. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 20:44:47](https://hyp.is/hR0YxseBEe2NZcPja10GXg/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: This opened the door for music (which was already popular mind you) and film to become such prominent artforms
- The Turing machine of 1936 was infinitely slow, its paper tape infinitely long and therefore inexistent. By contrast the computer, its technical successor, is a miracle of economy of time and space called forth by the exigencies of the second World War. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 21:13:20](https://hyp.is/kVc4ZseFEe2Jgzcx5VD4WQ/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: Like magic
- Data throughput and access time depend solely on physical parameters. Since 1948, when the transistor replaced the tubes/printed circuits of the second World War, and 1968 when integrated circuits replaced the single transistor, in each case reducing the space and time requirement by a factor of ten, real time analyses and real time syntheses of one-dimensional data flows (of speech or music for example) are no longer any problem. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 21:13:46](https://hyp.is/oS_H0MeFEe2e2Ds5x8tsEA/journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/download/14325/5101) — Group: #hist1900c-w2023
    - Annotation: And we're off to the races
