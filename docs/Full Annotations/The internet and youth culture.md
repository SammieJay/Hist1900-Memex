The internet is it's own social space, one that spans a larger variety of people than any other
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> To study the internet as a culture means to regard it as a social
space in its own right, exploring the forms of consumption and content
production, and the patterns of online communication and social interaction,
expression, and identity formation that are produced within this digital
social space, as well as how they are sustained by the resources available
within the online setting.[^1]

I feel that it's better to describe it as a series of subcultures than as one culture
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> When studied independently, the virtual space is a
coherent social space that exists entirely witnin a computer space, and in
which new rules and ways of being can emerge. Thus, youth operating within an
online community may be geographically dispersed, experiencing different
hours of the day in different locales, but they share an identical interest,
virtual space and rules, shared activities, and a common sense of belonging.[^1]

This is why the internet is so important in the lives of today's youth
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Adolescents use the internet to
accomplish important developmental tasks such as identity formation, social

conduct these developmental tasks, and, at the same time, through its use, it
is having an effect on their culture that in certain dimensions looks
different than that of the previous generation.[^1]
