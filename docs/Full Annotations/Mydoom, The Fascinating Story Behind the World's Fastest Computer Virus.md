And of course, in 2004 people just clicked links like that
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> On 26th January 2004, at around 13:00 UK time, the world of computer malware changed forever.



At that moment, emails began arriving in inboxes around the globe with unusual subject lines. The emails appeared to be errors of some sort, with a message suggesting that the user open the attachment in order to see the message itself.[^1]

Why you cant trust anything to users
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> The Mydoom virus relied on appearing as though it was a legitimate email which had somehow become corrupted, convincing users that the only way to read the message was to open the attachment. In truth, most people recognised the email for what it was: spam. Despite this, because of the way it can spread so easily, it only took a few unsuspecting victims to spread like wildfire.



And spread it did.[^1]

The best way for a virus to spread, is to hide until it is needed. Could be years
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Back in late January 2004, once the virus had spread to millions of computers all over the world, it essentially waited until 1st February, when it planned to begin a coordinated attack[^1]

This wouldn't be effective with only a few computers, but with the most infected computers in computer virus history this is super scary
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Transmitted via email, the singular goal of Mydoom is to infect computers, locate other email addresses on that computer, then send a copy of itself to those other email addresses. From there, it would simply repeat the process, spreading exponentially and creating a botnet which malicious parties could then use to carry out Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.[^1]

50 MILLION COMPUTERS HOLY COWABUNGA
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> The spread of Mydoom continued and finally hit its peak on 28th January 2004, when it was apparently responsible one in five of every email on the planet[KW1] [RL2] [RT3]  that day. At this stage, it’s thought at least 50 million computers were infected.[^1]

The second variant of MyDoom was unable to crack microsoft
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> MydoomB had certain coding errors within it which prevented it from spreading as quickly as the initial version had done. This meant that, when it attempted the DDoS attack on Microsoft on 3rd February 2004, the botnet wasn’t actually big enough to take down their sites.[^1]

Once the program fulfilled it's purpose it basically just turned off (but didn't go away)
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Once this attack had failed, it seemed that the Mydoom incident was essentially over. In fact, it was programmed to be over.[^1]

Which can happen with such vast and complex networks
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Importantly, any computer which had been infected was still infected, meaning any backdoors created by this malware were essentially still wide open.[^1]

1.1% of malware containing emails are still MyDoom related, that's crazy
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> As for where Mydoom is today, interestingly, there is still a level of circulation of those same infected emails from back in 2004. In 2019, analysis by Unit 42 showed that 1.1% of all email traffic with malware attachments were still Mydoom related[^1]
