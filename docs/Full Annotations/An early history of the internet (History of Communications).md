It's a system that emerged from many others coming together
&mdash;[[]]

## Source

We learned about this in class
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> During the late 1950s and early 1960s, two independent threads were being woven. One was the research thread that eventually led to the packet switching networks of today's Internet.[^1]

Not what we want for the internet, it needs consistent communication
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Circuit switching is problematic because data communications is bursty, that is, it is typically dominated by short bursts of activity with long periods of inactivity.[^1]

Start small before expanding
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> I chose to understand this influence in the case of a single node first and then to apply the results to the general network case.[^1]

He foresaw big things that came to be
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> “As of now, computer networks are still in their infancy, but as they grow up and become more sophisticated, we will probably see the spread of ‘computer utilities,’ which, like present electric and telephone utilities, will service individual homes and offices across the country.”[^1]

Very interesting that social connection was not anticipated
&mdash;[[]]

## Source

The start of something huge
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> In early October the second IMP was delivered by BBN to SRI in Menlo Park, California. The first high-speed link of what was to become the Internet was connected between those two IMPs at the “blazing” speed of 50 kb/s. Later in October, SRI connected their SDS 940 host computer to their IMP.[^1]

The network grows
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> After the short evaluation period following the initial four-node deployment, a continual succession of IMPs and networks were then added to the ARPANET.[^1]

As we saw with earlier information networks, companies were first adopting it for proprietary use
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> The reaction of the computer manufacturers to this ARPANET phenomenon was to create proprietary network architectures based on their own brand of computers.16. The tele- phone company continued to ignore it, but the open network that was the ARPANET thrived.[^1]

The ARPANET was combined with many other smaller networks to make the mother network that we can the Internet
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> The interconnection of networks was referred to as “internetworking” during the 1970s, a neologism from which the expanded ARPANET was eventually renamed as the Internet.[^1]

An immense amount of work went into making what we have
&mdash;[[]]

## Source
