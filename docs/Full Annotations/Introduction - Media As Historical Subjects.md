Though presented chronologically in parts I and II, the historiesof recorded sound and digital networking rendered here are intended to speak to oneother. In particular, I mean to turn "The Case of Phonographs" against "The Question ofthe Web," and thereby challenge readers to imagine what a meaningful history of today'snew media might eventually look like as well as to think about how accounts of media ingeneral should be written.[^1]

Society and technology's ever evolving nature means that some things get "built upon". And in some ways the things we built on are forgotten. Not dissimilar to how ancient Rome was not buried under earth and rock, but of more buildings and roads as the world moved forward.

> If one scientistor a group of scientists invents a new instrument, they must demonstrate persuasivelythat the instrument does or means what they say, that it represents the kind and order ofphenomena they intend. Other scientists start using the instrument, and ideally, its gen-eral acceptance soon helps to make it a transparent fact of scientific practice. Now scien-tists everywhere use the air pump, say, or the electrophoresis gel without thinking aboutit. They look through the instrument the way one looks through a telescope, without get-ting caught up in battles already won over whether and how it does the job. The instru-ment and all of its supporting protocols (norms about how and where one uses it, but alsostandards like units of measure) have become self-evident as the result of social processesthat attend both laboratory practice and scientific publication.[^1]
