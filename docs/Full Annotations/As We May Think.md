# As We May Think
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/

This is an interesting Idea, that one could create a language that is easily translated into logic (or some other computing friendly system) but I honestly doubt that it this will come to fruition. The time where languages are developed and spread aside from code seems to be long past. Perhaps I will be proven wrong one day

Space efficiency in our stored information will probably never stop being important, Because the ability to store more information in less physical space is something that drives technological information

This seems laughable by today's standards, the density at which we can store information now is far beyond any other point in history. What does that tell you?

This is a surprisingly difficult task, how do you teach a machine to add? then to multiply? then how do we use these simple mathematical systems to create images? record information? How do we let people interact with this machine? because that's definitely the most important part!

This touches on how using simple mathematics we can simulate and predict much more advanced outcomes. In fact a human doing a bunch of simple math equations could do all the processing needed for a CGI fluid simulation. It may take them more time than the universe has been existing but it's technically possible. The machines we have now are just able to do these calculations with immensely higher efficiency.

> One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely by the use of the mathematics of probability. The abacus, with its beads strung on parallel wires, led the Arabs to positional numeration and the concept of zero many centuries before the rest of the world; and it was a useful tool—so useful that it still exists.[^1]

The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.[^1]

Here is an example of a technology that was the right idea at the wrong time. Some things are just invented too early and are unfeasible to produce or use because of it

> Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of pencil and paper.[^1]
