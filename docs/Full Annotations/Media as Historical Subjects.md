An interesting definition
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> I define media as socially realized structures of communication, where structures in-clude both technological forms and their associated protocols, and where communica-tion is a cultural practice, a ritualized collocation of different people on the same mentalmap, sharing or engaged with popular ontologies of representation. 14[^1]

Anything that documents culture, is a production of it's own time
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> "the data of culture": records and documents, the archivable bitsor irreducible pieces of modern culture that seem archivable under prevailing and evolv-ing knowledge structures, and that thus suggest, demand, or defy preservation. Historyin this sense is no less of a cultural production in the past than it is in the present.[^1]

An example of culture being influenced by the ability to store and share data (in this case music)
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> The popular successof recording helped to foster "a vast range of new urban popular musics" (A. Jones 2001, 54),adaptive indigenous expressions that flourished amid cultural politics at once local andglobal.[^1]

Society and technology's ever evolving nature means that some things get "built upon". And in some ways the things we built on are forgotten. Not dissimilar to how ancient Rome was not buried under earth and rock, but of more buildings and roads as the world moved forward.

> If one scientistor a group of scientists invents a new instrument, they must demonstrate persuasivelythat the instrument does or means what they say, that it represents the kind and order ofphenomena they intend. Other scientists start using the instrument, and ideally, its gen-eral acceptance soon helps to make it a transparent fact of scientific practice. Now scien-tists everywhere use the air pump, say, or the electrophoresis gel without thinking aboutit. They look through the instrument the way one looks through a telescope, without get-ting caught up in battles already won over whether and how it does the job. The instru-ment and all of its supporting protocols (norms about how and where one uses it, but alsostandards like units of measure) have become self-evident as the result of social processesthat attend both laboratory practice and scientific publication.[^1]
