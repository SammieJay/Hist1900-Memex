The internet has brought about some immense levels of connectivity among oppressed peoples. This connectivity allows for immense amounts of documentation to be shared near instantly, and when everyone has access to a device on which you are able to film and document the world around you at all times, this can cause difficulties for oppressive regimes. It's no wonder the internet is as restricted as it is within the boarders of the CCP & North Korea. The change brought by the death of George Floyd would never have happened if it weren't for how connected the world is today. Guarding that connectivity is going to remain an important mission in the future.
