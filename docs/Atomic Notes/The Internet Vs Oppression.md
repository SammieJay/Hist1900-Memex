The internet has brought about some immense levels of connectivity among oppressed peoples. This connectivity allows for immense amounts of documentation to be shared near instantly, and when everyone has access to a device on which you are able to film and document the world around you at all times, this can cause difficulties for oppressive regimes. It's no wonder the internet is as restricted as it is within the boarders of the CCP & North Korea. The change brought by the death of George Floyd would never have happened if it weren't for how connected the world is today. Guarding that connectivity is going to remain an important mission in the future.

{Use this section to think about connections. Think about **how the newly created notes connect with your existing knowledge**. If you find some connections, connect the new notes with the older notes already in your system.To find these, ask:

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
