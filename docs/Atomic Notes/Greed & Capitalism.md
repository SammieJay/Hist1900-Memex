-  We often see companies & organizations being the ones to dictate whether emergent technologies are worthwhile based solely on profitability. This often caused resistance to overarching networks because why invest in something that doesn't only benefit the investor?
- The post office is often the place people went to pitch ideas for these expansive networks, but for often politically motivated reasons, the post office was difficult to bring on board.
- We saw that informational networks only really took off when there was a monetary or political use for them, whether that be by the military or by stockbrokers. The internet only came about when it was beneficial in the eyes of the capitalistic system.
