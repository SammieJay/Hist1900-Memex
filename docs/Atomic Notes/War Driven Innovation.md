As seen with the development of wireless technology, more robust networks, and many more technologies, wartime has driven many innovations that gave us the technology we rely on today. While WWI and WWII were bloody and merciless conflicts, governments often poured many resources into new research at this time, and this increase in resources gave us many innovations that we take for granted today. Examples include, wireless data transmission, reliable dispersed networks, telegraphy, logic operations (the fundamentals of modern computing), data encryption, and so much more.
