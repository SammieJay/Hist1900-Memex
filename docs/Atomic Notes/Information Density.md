## How information density relates to technological progress
- In the past few thousand years humans have gone from storing information on clay tablets, to [[Hist1900-Memex/docs/Class Notes/From Silk To Command Terminals|punch cards]], to multi-terrabyte capacity solid state drives
  
- This progress has been steady and consistent, it represents human progression accurately similar to processor density (another common indicator of technological progress)
  
- To me this indicates that perhaps our progression forward as a species hinges on our ability to efficiently store, share, and process information
