## How information density drives us
- In the past few thousand years humans have gone from storing information on clay tablets, to [[https://sammiejay.github.io/Hist1900-Memex/Class%20Notes/From%20Silk%20to%20Command%20Terminals/#punch-cards|punch cards]], to multi-terrabyte capacity solid state drives
  
- This progress has been steady and consistent, it represents human progression acurately similar to processor density (another common indicator of technological progress)
  
- To me this indicates that perhaps our progression forward on a species hinges on our ability to efficiently store, share, and process information
