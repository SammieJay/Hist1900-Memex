# Welcome
## Hello There!

I appreciate you taking the time to come visit my Memex! During my time with HIST1900c *History of the Internet* I've taken some notes (some more coherent than others), and this is a place where I have organized and furthered my exploration into the history of the massive informational system we call the internet and how it came to be. Feel free to look around, but I recommend starting with the [[1-Starting Point|Starting Point]] page!

I hope you enjoy your time here, and maybe even learn something along the way!
